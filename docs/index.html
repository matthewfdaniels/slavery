        <p class="by-lines">Slavery Data/Mapping: <a href="http://radicalcartography.net/slavery.html">Bill Rankin</a><br>Code/Story: <a href="http://twitter.com/matthew_daniels">Matt Daniels</a>
        </p>
        <p class="prose prose-lead">Last year, Ava Duvernay released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V66F3WU2CKk">13th</a>, a documentary that tries to draw a thread between slavery and incarceration.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">It’s a very interesting twist, as the discussion between racism and mass incarceration rarely stretches back 150 years. Slavery <i>feels</i> far away. The over-riding narrative is that while we might not be a post-racism society, we’re certainly a post-slavery one.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">But there’s a new dataset to consider. Cartographer Bill Rankin <a href="http://www.radicalcartography.net/index.html?slavery">recently compiled</a> some of the most detailed maps of slavery after transcribing, by hand, records from historical archives. They reveal many similarities between 1860 and today’s black population, political voting, and incarceration. The shape of slavery, it seems, continues to leave its trace.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">In short, the discussion of slavery, in today’s terms, might not be as far reaching as it seems.
        </p>
        <div class="divider">
        </div>
        <p class="prose slavery-trigger">This is slavery in 1860, just before the civil war ended.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">If you’re not a student of US history, the white/yellow areas might be shocking, geographies where slaves were 40-50%+ of the population.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">I recently stumbled across <a href="http://kottke.org/16/09/on-the-shifting-role-of-racism-in-american-slavery">this post</a> by Jason Kottke, who highlighted an <a href="https://soundcloud.com/econtalk">EconTalk podcast</a> about how the South <i>justified</i> slavery, that "Southern whites came to believe, like really believe, that they were doing their slaves a favor by enslaving them and that the slaves were better off than they would be in Africa."
        </p>
        <p class="prose prose-quote">“The original justification for slavery, which was the Roman, wasn’t good enough…it was that if you lost a battle and were captured, then you might either be killed or kept as a slave...
        </p>
        <p class="prose prose-quote">Well, that didn’t work in the American South because they wanted to maintain slaves...and to have a justification that would allow them to enslave the children…you are not going to be a slave if you are born to a slave, because you didn’t lose in battle: you would have been free.
        </p>
        <p class="prose prose-quote">So, the Southerners needed a different way...which is that slaves are people who are either morally inferior or lack the judgment to make independent choices. They are like children or like horses. That means that you actually have a positive-good justification for enslaving them...it would be cruel of me to set it loose to let it run around, because it’s not capable of taking care of itself."
        </p>
        <p class="prose zoom-trigger">And now you can imagine the implications of the Civil War. Parts of Louisiana and South Carolina had a 50%+ slavery population. The white population wasn’t merely weighing an economic loss, but rather a complete disruption of their moral mental model.
        </p>
        <div class="divider">
        </div>
        <p class="prose black-pop-trigger">The thread from slavery to mass incarceration is incredibly complex. Anecdotally, it begins with the premise that the South setup a far harsher criminal system that targeted former slaves for petty crimes (i.e., white control). Many of these felons, depending on state laws, lost their right to vote, creating a disgustingly legal form of disenfranchisement.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">Unfortunately, there’s not a ton of data about the prison system in 1860. But starting in 1910, we can begin to see some clear patterns.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">Surprisingly, the population trends in 1860 still hold today. The percent of black people in the US is nearly identical to 1860: hovering at 13% - 14%. Even the per capita breakdown, especially in the South, hasn’t changed much in 150 years.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">The stark density of black communities in the South is shocking. While census maps aren’t front-page news, check out this map of Democrat (blue) to Republican (red) voting in the 2012 Presidential Election. Parts of it could have been drawn directly from the 1860 slavery map (the actual geographic shape is caused soil conditions, <a href="http://www.deepseanews.com/2012/06/how-presidential-elections-are-impacted-by-a-100-million-year-old-coastline/">explained here</a>).
        </p>
        <div class="voting-map">
        </div>
        <p class="prose voting-sub">Democrat vs. Republican Voting in<br>2012 Presidential Election
        </p>
        <p class="prose show-bubbles">Over the past one hundred years, I’ve also layered on incarceration rates (both for federal and state prison). Even in 1910, fifty years after slavery, the South led the pack in prisoners as a percent of its population. Today, the rate of incarceration has quintupled…but again, the South is among the worst offenders when it comes the number of people it imprisons.
        </p>
        <div class="divider">
        </div>
        <p class="prose">The US’s prison system has no shortage of shocking data points. We have 5% of the world’s population and 25% of its prisoners. 40% of prisoners are Black (again, the US has a ~13.5% black population). That means that about 2% of all black people are in prison.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">But the detail is what matters. Each state has it’s own policies. In 2010, Louisiana led the US in incarceration rate. We’ll never conclusively agree that it’s <i>because slavery</i>. Yet, in this context, the US’s history of slavery doesn’t seem so distant to ignore completely.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">The last map is the only multi-decade, county-level data that’s available for the prison system: jail incarceration per 100,000 people.
        </p>
        <p class="prose incar-trigger">Again, we see similar patterns from 1860…some of the highest jail incarceration in Southern states, especially along the Mississippi.
